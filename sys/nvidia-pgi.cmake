# Toolchain file for

# Nvidia pgi compiler
#
# Notes:
#
#  * Settings here should work out of the box on Ubuntu (tested on 18.4). Other build environments
#    may need some fine tuning.
#
#  * CMake format: Command line options (e.g. compiler flags) space separated, other kind
#    of lists semicolon separated.
#
#  * Variables containing library search paths are empty by default. The CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
#    environment variable should be set up correctly, so that CMake can find those libraries
#    automatically. If that is not the case, override those variables to add search paths
#    manually

# External libraries

# NOTE: Libraries with CMake export files (e.g. ELSI and if the HYBRID_CONFIG_METHODS variable
# contains the "Find" method also libNEGF, libMBD, ScalapackFx and MpiFx) are included by searching
# for the export file in the paths defined in the CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH **environment** variable. Make
# sure your CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH variable is set up accordingly.

# LAPACK and BLAS
#set(LAPACK_LIBRARY "openblas" CACHE STRING "LAPACK and BLAS libraries to link")
